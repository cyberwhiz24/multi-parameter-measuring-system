# NRF24L01_WSN_Based_Multi-Parameter-Measuring-System
This project makes use of an NRF24L01 wireless transciever to transmit data from a node to the sink.
Each node contains an NRF24L01 wireless transciever, an Arduino Nano, a PIR Sennsor, tilt sensor, DHT11(Temperature and Humidity Sensor), and a 9V battery for power supply to the Circuit.
While the Sink Node contains a Buzzer, Arduino UNO, an NRF24L01, a switch and a TFT LCD color display.
